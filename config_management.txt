Configuration Management (CM) is essential in software development because it establishes and maintains consistency of a product's performance, 
functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life.

Key benefits include:
- Tracking changes and versions.
- Facilitating team collaboration without conflicts.
- Allowing rollbacks to previous stable states if errors occur.
